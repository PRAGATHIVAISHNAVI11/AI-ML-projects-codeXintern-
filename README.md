üß† Machine Learning Projects Portfolio
Overview

This repository contains two beginner-to-intermediate Machine Learning projects demonstrating classification, data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model evaluation.
Both projects are fully implemented in Python using scikit-learn, pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and NLTK.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Iris Flower Classification

Objective:
Classify iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on petal and sepal measurements.

Key Features & Steps:

Loaded the Iris dataset from scikit-learn.

Explored the dataset visually with scatter plots, histograms, and pair plots.

Split data into training and test sets.

Trained and compared Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree classifiers.

Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

Visualized decision boundaries for petal features.

Compared model performance with accuracy bar charts.

Skills Gained:

Numeric data analysis & visualization

Classification modeling & algorithm comparison

Model evaluation & decision boundary visualization

Python, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Results & Visuals:

All classifiers achieved 100% accuracy on the test set.

Petal length & width are the most important features.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Spam Mail Detector

Objective:
Classify messages as spam or ham (non-spam) using textual data.

Key Features & Steps:

Loaded the SMS Spam Collection dataset from UCI.

Applied text preprocessing: lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopwords removal, tokenization.

Converted text into numeric features with TF-IDF vectorization.

Split data into training and test sets.

Trained and compared Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression classifiers.

Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrices, and prediction confidence scores.

Developed an interactive demo to type a message, select a model, and get predictions with confidence bar chart visualization.

Skills Gained:

Text preprocessing & feature extraction

Basic NLP & classification modeling

Model evaluation & interactive prediction

Python, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, NLTK

Run Instructions:

cd Spam_Mail_Detector
python spam_mail_detector.py


Enter a message and select a model (Naive Bayes / Logistic Regression).

See prediction, confidence score, and confidence bar chart.
